# Design Workflow & Human Instructions

This document guides the human operator through the **Design Prep** and **Screen Generation** phases of the KidDraw Learn project.

## 🏹 The Goal

To ensure that all UI generated by AI (Stitch) follows the core principles defined in our **Design Bible** (Sitemap, Style Guide, Interaction Guide) and integrates seamlessly back into our Flutter codebase.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 0. Generate the Design Bible

Before coding, lets define the "How it Feels" in `project-management/design/`.

Tag the Project Foundation Folder `project-management/project/` and design bible template folder `project-management/design_template` then use this prompt with your AI Coding agent e.g. Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex:

```markdown
I want to create a Design Bible for my project.

Act as a Senior UI/UX Designer. Your goal is to help me define the design foundation by filling out `project-management/design/` using the templates provided in `project-management/design_template/`.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT update the files in `project-management/design_template/`. Use them only as a reference to create the final files in `project-management/design/`.

Please interview me to gather all necessary details. Ask questions covering:

- **Sitemap**: Navigation and screen hierarchy.
- **Style Guide**: Visual tokens (Colors, Type, "Chunky UI").
- **Interaction Guide**: Behavioral rules (Guardrails, Feedback loops).
- **Content Strategy**: Voice, tone, and nomenclature for Parents and Children.
- **Component Specs**: The visual "Kit of Parts".
```

### 1. Prepare the "Design Bible"

Once generated, review and refine these files to ensure they perfectly capture your creative vision:

- `sitemap.md`: Navigation and screen hierarchy.
- `style_guide.md`: Colors, Typography, and "Chunky UI" rules.
- `interaction_guide.md`: Behavioral rules (Guardrails, Feedback loops).
- `content_strategy.md`: Voice, tone, and nomenclature for Parents and Children.
- `ui_components.md`: The "Kit of Parts" for visual consistency.

### 2. Screen Generation (Stitch)

1. Go to [https://stitch.withgoogle.com/](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) and create/open your project.
2. **Context Upload**: Upload the **Project Foundation Files:** **Vision**, **PRD**, **FRD**, **epic_backlogs.md**, and the **Design Bible** files listed above. This ensures Stitch has the same mental model as the development team.
3. **Prompting**: Use the Sitemap to ask Stitch to generate all the necessary screens base on the design bible.
   - _Example_: "Generate all the necessary screens for the project based on the Sitemap and Design Bible."
4. **Refinement**: Iterate on the screens in Stitch until they match the success criteria in the PRD.

### 3. Export & Integration

Once the designs are ready:

1. **Export Code**: Click the screen > select "more" > "view code" - this will show the html code for the screen. Copy this code and save it in the appropriate folder in `project-management/design/` (e.g., `design/Parent Management Dashboard/`).
2. **Organization**: Create a subfolder for each major feature in `project-management/design/` (e.g., `design/Parent Management Dashboard/`).
3. **Save Index**: Place the `index.html` and any exported assets in these subfolders.

## 💡 Why This Works (For the Next Human)

By using a **Source of Truth** (Vision) and a **Design Bible** (Specs) before generating UI, we prevent "Design Drift." This process ensures that when the AI agent starts coding the Flutter UI, it isn't guessing—it has the exact visual and behavioral references it needs to build a high-fidelity application that matches the user's intent.
