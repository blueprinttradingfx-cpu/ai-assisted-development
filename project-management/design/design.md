# Design Workflow & Human Instructions

This document guides the human operator through the **Design Prep** and **Screen Generation** phases of the KidDraw Learn project.

## 🏹 The Goal

To ensure that all UI generated by AI (Stitch) follows the core principles defined in our **Design Bible** (Sitemap, Style Guide, Interaction Guide) and integrates seamlessly back into our Flutter codebase.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 0. Generate the Design Bible

Before coding, lets define the "How it Feels" in `project-management/design/`.

Tag the Project Foundation Folder `project-management/project/` and design bible template folder `project-management/design_template` then use this prompt with your AI Coding agent e.g. Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex:

```markdown
I want to create a Design Bible for my project.

Act as a Senior UI/UX Designer. Your goal is to help me define the design foundation by filling out `project-management/design/` using the templates provided in `project-management/design_template/`.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT update the files in `project-management/design_template/`. Use them only as a reference to create the final files in `project-management/design/`.

Please interview me to gather all necessary details. Ask questions covering:

- **Sitemap**: Navigation and screen hierarchy.
- **Style Guide**: Visual tokens (Colors, Type, "Chunky UI").
- **Interaction Guide**: Behavioral rules (Guardrails, Feedback loops).
- **Content Strategy**: Voice, tone, and nomenclature for Parents and Children.
- **Component Specs**: The visual "Kit of Parts".
```

### 1. Prepare the "Design Bible"

Once generated, review and refine these files to ensure they perfectly capture your creative vision:

- `sitemap.md`: Navigation and screen hierarchy.
- `style_guide.md`: Colors, Typography, and "Chunky UI" rules.
- `interaction_guide.md`: Behavioral rules (Guardrails, Feedback loops).
- `content_strategy.md`: Voice, tone, and nomenclature for Parents and Children.
- `ui_components.md`: The "Kit of Parts" for visual consistency.

### 2. Screen Generation (Stitch)

1. Go to [https://stitch.withgoogle.com/](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) and create/open your project.

To minimize hallucinations and ensure high-fidelity output, we use a focused, one-by-one generation approach.

1. **Upload Visual Foundation**: Upload the **`style_guide.md`**. This is the **ONLY** file needed for visual context. It contains the look, feel, palette, and ambiance rules.
2. **Context Prompt**:
   > "I have provided the `style_guide.md` which defines the 'Creative Garden' ambiance and visual tokens for my project. Use this for all UI elements.
   >
   > I want to generate screens **one-by-one**. Please wait for my specific screen request from the `screen_list.md`."
3. **Generate One-by-One**: Refer to **`screen_list.md`** and ask Stitch to generate each screen individually.
   - _Example_: "Based on the Style Guide, generate the **Activity Launcher** screen. It should feature a grid of activities for a child named Leo, using the 'Chunky UI' style and Green/Blue palette."
4. **Refinement**: Iterate on each screen until it perfectly matches the vision.

### 3. Export & Integration Tracking

Once the designs are ready:

1. **Export Code**: Click the screen > select "more" > "view code" - this will show the html code for the screen. Copy this code and save it in the appropriate folder in `project-management/design/` (e.g., `design/11. Parent Dashboard/`).
2. **Organization**: Create a subfolder for each major feature in `project-management/design/`.
3. **Save Index**: Place the `index.html` and any exported assets in these subfolders.
4. **Update the Tracker**: Go to `project-management/design/screen_list.md` and check the box `[x] Generated` for the specific screen you just exported. This prevents orphan screens from being lost.

## 💡 Why This Works (For the Next Human)

By using a **Source of Truth** (Vision) and a **Design Bible** (Specs) before generating UI, we prevent "Design Drift." This process ensures that when the AI agent starts coding the Flutter UI, it isn't guessing—it has the exact visual and behavioral references it needs to build a high-fidelity application that matches the user's intent.
