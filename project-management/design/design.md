# Design Workflow & Human Instructions

This document guides the human operator through the **Design Prep** and **Screen Generation** phases of the KidDraw Learn project.

## 🏹 The Goal

To ensure that all UI generated by AI (Stitch) follows the core principles defined in our **Design Bible** (Sitemap, Style Guide, Interaction Guide) and integrates seamlessly back into our Flutter codebase.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 0. Generate the Design Bible

Before generating high-fidelity screens, you must have the **Design Bible** files ready. You can generate these by providing your AI Coding Agent with the **Vision**, **PRD**, and **FRD** files and using the following prompt:

```markdown
Based on the project's Vision, PRD, and FRD, please help me generate the following Design Bible files in `project-management/design/`:

1.  `sitemap.md`: Map the screen hierarchy and user flows.
2.  `style_guide.md`: Define colors, typography, and "Chunky UI" principles.
3.  `interaction_guide.md`: Define how the app reacts to user inputs and celebrations.
4.  `content_strategy.md`: Define the tone of voice and nomenclature for Parents and Children.
5.  `ui_components.md`: Create a "Kit of Parts" for visual consistency.
```

### 1. Prepare the "Design Bible"

Once generated, review and refine these files to ensure they perfectly capture your creative vision:

- `sitemap.md`: Navigation and screen hierarchy.
- `style_guide.md`: Colors, Typography, and "Chunky UI" rules.
- `interaction_guide.md`: Behavioral rules (Guardrails, Feedback loops).
- `content_strategy.md`: Voice, tone, and nomenclature for Parents and Children.
- `ui_components.md`: The "Kit of Parts" for visual consistency.

### 2. Screen Generation (Stitch)

1. Go to [https://stitch.withgoogle.com/](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) and create/open your project.
2. **Context Upload**: Upload the **Project Foundation Files:** **Vision**, **PRD**, **FRD**, **epic_backlogs.md**, and the **Design Bible** files listed above. This ensures Stitch has the same mental model as the development team.
3. **Prompting**: Use the Sitemap to ask Stitch to generate all the necessary screens base on the design bible.
   - _Example_: "Generate all the necessary screens for the project based on the Sitemap and Design Bible."
4. **Refinement**: Iterate on the screens in Stitch until they match the success criteria in the PRD.

### 3. Export & Integration

Once the designs are ready:

1. **Export Code**: Click the screen > select "more" > "view code" - this will show the html code for the screen. Copy this code and save it in the appropriate folder in `project-management/design/` (e.g., `design/Parent Management Dashboard/`).
2. **Organization**: Create a subfolder for each major feature in `project-management/design/` (e.g., `design/Parent Management Dashboard/`).
3. **Save Index**: Place the `index.html` and any exported assets in these subfolders.

## 💡 Why This Works (For the Next Human)

By using a **Source of Truth** (Vision) and a **Design Bible** (Specs) before generating UI, we prevent "Design Drift." This process ensures that when the AI agent starts coding the Flutter UI, it isn't guessing—it has the exact visual and behavioral references it needs to build a high-fidelity application that matches the user's intent.
